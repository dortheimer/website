				<h2>About</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Hello, I am Jonathan Dortheimer.</p>
				<p>I teach at the <a href="https://www.ariel.ac.il/wp/architecture/" target="_blank">School of
						Architecture</a> at
					Ariel University, and lead the <a href="https://aairl.com" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence in
						Architecture Laboratory</a> (AAIRL), which
					investigates the interface between artificial intelligence and design.
					I am also a guest scholar at the <a href="https://www.arc.ed.tum.de/en/ai/" target="_blank">Chair of
						Architectural Informatics</a> at the School of Design and Engineering
					at the Technical University of Munich. </p>

				<p>Over the years, I had excellent teachers who inspired me, and I am grateful for their guidance. I was
					a postdoctoral student at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and at Cornell-Tech in New
					York, where I worked in the MTRL and FAR Labs under the guidance of Prof. Aaron Sprecher and Prof.
					Wendy Ju. I received my PhD from Tel Aviv University in 2021 under the guidance of Prof. Eran Neuman
					and Prof. Tova Milo. In addition, I have a master's degree (MA) under the guidance of Prof. Talia
					Margalit and a bachelor's degree in architecture from Tel Aviv University.</p>

				<h2>Research</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>My research focuses on developing new computing methods to enhance the design
					capabilities of architectural teams and decision-makers. My research interests include artificial
					intelligence, human-computer interaction, digital design, and collaborative design. I have developed
					the
					world's first chatbot for effective public participation in urban planning, which assisted in the
					strategic planning of the metropolis of Bogotá in Colombia and urban renewal in Israel at a
					neighborhood scale. In addition, in my dissertation, I developed a method for architectural planning
					that allows the participation of many architects simultaneously with the community in a way that
					leads to consensus in the design.</p>

				<p>The chatbot research won first place in an international competition for smart cities, and other
					projects won grants from the Ministry of Science and funding from industry in Israel.</p>

						<h3>AI-Driven Participatory and Democratic Design </h3>
						<p>I focus on the exciting blend of computer technology and collaborative design in creating our
							physical spaces, all guided by democratic values. My interest in this area began with the
							open-source movement, which inspired me to explore how we can create environments where
							collective intelligence thrives. I do this using computer-mediated interactions and the
							innovative potential of generative AI.</p>

						<h3>Photoparty</h3>
						<p>I led the development of an innovative social photo-sharing application that leveraged

							I worked on the project with my partner, <a

							included <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshliberty/">Josh Liberty</a>, <a

						</p>
						<p>Supported by Intel, this project broke new ground by establishing a local mesh network,
							allowing devices to synchronize independently of the internet or cloud storage. Although the
							app demonstrated exceptional functionality, it was ultimately not released due to Intel
							discontinuing CCF support.

						<p>This project underscored the transformative potential of mesh networks. I am particularly
							fascinated by the ability to create resilient urban communication systems that can endure
							physical disruptions. </p>

						<h3>Gamer.co.il</h3>
						<p>In the late 1990s, Israel witnessed the birth of its first dedicated computer games website, initially known as PC-Action. This pioneering website was renamed "Gamer" and quickly became a hub for gamers, offering game reviews, downloads, cheat codes, game servers, and, most notably, a forum that facilitated one of the largest online communities in the country. </p>

						<p>The term "gamer," now ubiquitous, was not yet coined in Hebrew when it launched. At the time, gamers were called "computer players." The website Gamer played a significant role in popularizing the term "gamer" within Israel, as the "computer players" began identifying themselves as "gamers."</p>

							<p>By 2002, Gamer boasted a team of over ten journalists and more than 40 community managers, with its users generating over 9,000 pieces of content daily—a remarkable feat for the time.</p>

								<p>Gamer's influence extended beyond the digital realm as it organized large-scale LAN parties in collaboration with community leaders. These events, held in some of Israel's most prominent venues, hosted national gaming championships, with winners going on to represent Israel in the World Cyber Games.</p>

									<p>Eventually, Gamer was sold to Hed Arzi and Netvision. However, due to mismanagement and the subsequent sale of Nana to Channel 10, the website ceased operations. Despite its closure, Gamer's legacy as a trailblazer in Israel's gaming culture remains significant. The vibrant community and forums laid the groundwork for creating Dex, Israel's first social network, in 2005.</p>
